# Cards Inventory
An interactive inventory of handmade cards and supplies used to make them, using PostgreSQL and Node, and Supertest with Mocha and Chai.expect for testing server-side code. In the future, I plan on making the front end in React-Redux. FOr now, the front end is static, and user input is sent via HTML forms.
